> Summit County, Colorado encompasses several mountain towns including Dillon and Frisco, where the majority of our activities will take place!

## Closest Airport

The most accessible airborne destination is Denver International Airport. From DIA, it's <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Denver+International+Airport+(DEN),+8500+Pe%C3%B1a+Blvd,+Denver,+CO+80249/Dillon,+Colorado/data=!4m8!4m7!1m2!1m1!1s0x876c7f2a98ff44ff:0x49583bb435b59c6a!1m2!1m1!1s0x876a56970bb0e355:0xd821373c4991fa7f!3e0?ved=2ahUKEwiK6YTDv9vgAhUCUt8KHWpBBU0Q-A8wAHoECAUQCw" target="_blank">just under two hours</a> by car to the town of Dillon. From Denver, it's closer to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Denver,+CO/Dillon,+Colorado/@39.6970243,-105.8081689,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x876b80aa231f17cf:0x118ef4f8278a36d6!2m2!1d-104.990251!2d39.7392358!1m5!1m1!1s0x876a56970bb0e355:0xd821373c4991fa7f!2m2!1d-106.0433518!2d39.6302643!3e0" target="_blank"> an hour and a half. </a>

## Transportation Details

There are shuttle options to/from the airport, and we will provide day-of transportation for our guests. 

In Summit County, rideshares such as Uber/Lyft are available, along with the <a href="https://www.summitcountyco.gov/360/Summer-Schedule" target="_blank"> free public bus system </a> “Summer Stage” which runs multiple routes throughout the area. This means you technically don’t need to rent a car for the weekend. However if you feel comfortable driving in the mountains and would like more freedom to explore, renting a car is definitely your best bet. If you have questions about the drive, or transportation in general, please <a href="mailto:jessicalaub@msn.com?Subject=Wedding Travel Questions&cc=jsangio1@gmail.com" target="_top">get in touch with us</a>! 

## Lay of the Land

Once you travel along I-70 from Denver and through the long Lincoln Tunnel (don’t try to hold your breath and make a wish, trust us we’ve tried!) you’ll drive down a big hill and into Summit County. You’ll see Lake Dillon on your left, and enter the town of Silverthorne once you get off the highway. The area consists of multiple ski mountains (including Keystone and Arapahoe Basin), the town of Dillon (on the NE side of the lake) and Frisco (on the SW side of the lake). 

Depending on where your lodging is located, you probably won’t be more than a 10-15 minute drive from both our ceremony and reception spots. See the map below to get a better idea of where everything is located:
