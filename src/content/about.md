## Use this website as an App!

This website was built as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications" target="_blank">PWA</a> (Progressive Web App). This means you have the ability to "install" it like a normal app on to your device. Once installed, the app won't require an internet connection to work! See these links for more details: 
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbkJqeNAbtY" target="_blank"> Android </a> 
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nlmv2i301U" target="_blank"> iOS </a>
